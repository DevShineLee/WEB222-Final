    <section id="class-recommendation">
      <h2>Class Recommendation</h2>
      <p>
        As someone who has spent countless hours exploring the realms of Azeroth, I'd like to offer a personal recommendation for newcomers: the Hunter class. For beginners, choosing the Hunter class can be a fantastic choice. Hunters have the unique ability to tame pets, which can serve as a loyal companion in battles, drawing aggro and allowing you to attack from a safe distance. This can be especially advantageous for those who prefer not to be directly in harm's way. Whether you're wandering the forests or facing fearsome foes, having a trusty pet by your side can greatly enhance your adventure in World of Warcraft.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, if you're looking for a versatile experience and want to try your hand at tanking, healing, and dealing damage, I highly recommend the Druid class. Druids have the ability to shapeshift into different forms, allowing them to fulfill different roles within a group. Whether you want to tank enemies as a bear, heal your allies as a tree, or deal damage in various forms, the Druid class offers a unique and varied playstyle that can provide a well-rounded experience for players.
